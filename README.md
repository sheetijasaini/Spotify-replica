## Project Overview

This is a desktop application inspired by the well-known music streaming platform Spotify. It is developed as a personal project by **Sheetija Saini**, B.Tech 4th Year, Computer Science & Engineering (CSE).

**Note:** This project is strictly for educational and demonstration purposes. It will never be used for commercial purposes. Some files are intentionally missing to avoid copyright infringement and to comply with GitHub policies.

## Features

- **Spotify-like Interface:** Modern UI for desktop computers, similar to Spotify.
- **User Modes:**
	- **Admin Mode:** Accessed via the login page using credentials `admin`/`admin`. The administrator can add, remove, and modify entries in the database through an intuitive interface.
	- **User Mode:** Users must register before accessing the main interface. Registered users can:
		- Listen to music
		- Search for albums, songs, and artists
		- Add friends and view their favorite albums
		- Interact with songs using the bottom menu (play, pause, etc.)
		- View their own profile and friends' profiles
